# Churn Analysis for SyriaTel
 
This project uses predictive modeling classification and data visualization to examine customer churn at SyriaTel, a telecommunication company. The objective is to identify patterns in customer behavior and build and evaluate the best model to forecast churn.

## 1. Business Understanding
In the telecommunications industry, churn refers to the number of customers who were previously active but are no longer using the company's services. A lot of effort and resources are used to acquire customers, and therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the customers stay with the company for as long as possible.

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn, enabling proactive intervention.

## 2. Data Understanding
The dataset consists of 3,333 rows and 21 columns and contains both categorical and numerical variables
The target variable is churn (Boolean), checking whether the customer churned (True/False). Customer demographics data includes account length, phone number etc.
Usage data includes daytime calls, evening calls, nighttime calls, and international calls and customer service data includes customer service calls, and customer support interactions.

## 3. Data Cleaning
Data Cleaning is necessary to prepare the data for analysis and modeling. The data cleaning actions taken include;
- Removed duplicates and missing values (no duplicates or missing data)   
- Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., phone number, area code).      
- Converted categorical variables to numeric (e.g., international plan: Yes = 1, No = 0).      
- Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE. 
The outcome of the cleaning exercise was a clean data set with 18 features.
